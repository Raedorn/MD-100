Module 4
	------------------------------
		Implement Device registration

	Understand the challanges to data access for multiple device types
		- Devices 	- Management
		- Apps		- Access
		- Data		- Protection

	New challanges to IT departments include:
		- allowing users to work on devices of their choice, while providing consistent access to corporate resources.
		- Allowing work from home/remote work scenarios
		- Unified enviormend between company-owned devices and BYOD devices
		- Protecting data, enforcing policies and compiance requirements

		------------------------------------------------
		Explore the Microsoft device strategy framework

		Four core framework
		- Low trust
			- Here's your own device
		- High trust
			- Choose your own device (CYOD)
		- High freedom
			-On your own Employee owned
		- Low trust
			- BYOD - Company managed
			- BYOD - employee managed of company policies
		- Low freedom

		On your own (highest security risk)
			- Employees provide their own devices. No security policies are in place, no management of devices and any device is acceptable

		Bring your own device
			- BYOD unmanaged device
				> Company does not manage the devices
				> Users are responsible for implementing and managing company policies on their devices

		Choose your own device (also called CYOD)
			- The company provides a device to the employees
			- The company provides/allows the users to choose from a list of devices that are compatible with the company's apps and management infrastructure

		Here's your own device
			- One device is approved for the company's mobile platform and the device is provided to the employees.


	Explore device registration
		------------------------------------
		After a user enrolls a device:
			- The device is associated with the user's account in the company directory
			- The device object is created in AD DS = establishes a link between the user and the device
			- the user certificate is installed on the device

	Examine how device registration works
		------------------------------------

		Main purposes of the device registration feature are to provide
			- Registration in AD DS for non-domain joined devices
			- SSO for selected application and resources in a company's internal network
		Device registration works by using device registrations service and Active directory Dederation Services with Device authentication enabled.

		When a user registers a device, Device registration service will provision a certificate for the device - the cert is used to authenticate the device with company resources.

	Assess infrastructure requirements to support device registration
		----------------------------------------
		The following requirements must be met for Device Registration to be compatible.

			- Active Directory enviorment
			- Public key infrastructure
				> CRL
				> AIA
				> Delta CRL
				----pkiview.msc - view certificates
			- AD FS
			- Device Registration service
			- A DNS record for the host named Enterpriseregistration 
				> The DNS server must resolve this name to the IP address of the AD FS server. Must also use one of the Subject Alternative Name attributes in the SSL cert
			- Web Application Proxy
			- A supported operating system on the device
