DIFFERENT PROCESSES AND METHODS OF INSTALLING WINDOWS 10/11
===========================================================

1.	Wipe and reimage the device
2.	Install a custom enginered image
3	Reconfigure the existing OS to the orginization's desired spesifications

Methods
===========================================================
>	In-place upgrade
		>> Upgrading the existing OS to a newer version/feature release while keeping the user data intact

		>> Phases - Checking the system, Installing windows with Windows preinstallation enviorment (PE), The first setup, Installing the windows operating system and the second startup

>	New deployment
	> Involves performing a clean installation.
		>> Install media
		>> System Image
		>> Windows Autopilot

>	Refresh
	> Reverts the machine to its original state of the image used to install windows.

>	Provisioning
	> Windows Configuration Designer Tool
		> Used for provisioning packages with spesific configurations and settings to devices

>	Migration (wipe-and-load, side-by-side)
	> When migrating a user from the one OS to the other.
		>> Side-By-Side migration
			>>> Replacing the users device - backup user settings, perform a clean installation, reinstall applications, restore user settings on destination device (new device)

		>>	In-place migration
			>>> "Wipe and load"

UPGRADE AND MIGRATE WINDOWS CLIENTS
============================================================

The process of upgrading Win 10
>	Evaluate 	- Check hardware requirements (Pc health check/Update Compliance, Endpoint Analytics). Check program & driver compatabilities on the OS - Check out Windows ADK for testing
>	Back Up 	- Make use of Onedrive, or the USMT (User state migration tool)
>	Upgrade		- 
>	Verify		- 
>	Update

>	Windows OS editions can't downgrade from Pro edition to Home addtion
>	Upgrading to the relative edditons is possible (next level - Home, Pro, Enterprise, Education)
>	In Windows 10, changing edditons is easier than ever, the OS now reflects on te license as to what eddition to have active / The OS refelects the new license if the license changes to another edtion

COMPARE UPGRADE AND MIGRATION CONSIDERATIONS
---------------------------------------------

In-place upgrade
	Perform an inplace upgrade when you want to replace the existing version of Windows and keep all user applications, files and settings.

In-place upgrade using feature update
	The process that is handled within Settings > Update and security.. This process can happen in the background and setup.exe is not required to run for this upgrade.

Refresh
	Easier than perfomring an in-place migration - As you can keep user data in tact

Migration
	Primarily used when moving the exisiting user to a new computer

Side-by-side migration
	Used when replacing the users device. Use USMT to migrate data and settings to the new target deivce

In-Place migration
	Pridominantly used to remove unmanged, excessive, non-standard OS configurations or efforts to clean up years of legacy applications and data.


------------------------
Upgrade vs. Migration
-----------------------

Consider the following advantages and disadvantages

In-place upgrade considerations
-------------------------------
Advantages										Disadvantages
>	Retains user, application settings			> 	Does not take advantage of the oppertunity to start fresh
>	Preserves installed applications			> 	Small chance of preserved applications may not work after upgrading
>	Does not require extra storage				>	Remnant files or settins from in-place upgrade may contribute to performance and security issues
>	Affects user productivity minimally			> 	Some upgrade paths may not be supported
>	Provides a simpler setup process 			
>	Rollback is available


Migration considerations
------------------------
Advantages 												Disadvantages
>	Oppertunity to clean up exisiting computers			> 	Require the use of migration tools / Capture restore user settings 
>	Allow for installation of any editions				> 	Requires reinstallation of applications
>	Provides an opertunity to reconfigure hardware		> 	Requires storage space for user files to be migrated
>	Malicious software will be removed					> 	Will have an impact on user productivity

Explore imaging and autopilot
=============================

Benefits															Disadvantages
--------															-------------

- Eliminates repetetive tasks and manual installations				- Takes a lot of effort to create and maintain,
- Removes inconsisitancy and potential user errors					- Very complex and requires tools to implement / manage
- Can be done remotely with little to none action from IT's 		- Consumes bandwidth

-----------
Auto Pilot
-----------------------------------------------------------
Used to assist with managing images/reimage devices and maintain the fleet from a remote perspective


==============================
	DEPLOYMENT STRATAGIES
==============================
Several methods and stratagies are availible for different scenarios and should be considered when attempting to imaging/deployment processes.


High-Touch Deployment (HTI)
----------------------
(Small sized Organizations 50-100 clients)
"High-touch retal media deployment stratagy" - Simplest way to deploy Windows. Insert Windows media and run the setup program - manual installation that requires each prompt to be answered within the setup program.

"High-touch with standard image" - Involves the creation of a standard image by using Windows ADK.

Lite-Touch Deployment (LTI)
---------------------
(Medium-sized organizations (200-500 clients))
Uses management tools such as MDT or Microsft Intune. - Uses a centrally managed console to automate the delivery of the OS, configurations and applications.

Zero-Touch Deployment (ZTI)
---------------------------
(Large computers - 500 client computers)
Uses MDT and/or Intune togehter with Microsoft Endpoint Configurations Manager to deliver more streamlined, fully automated deployment that doesn't require user interaction.

Bring your Own Device (BYOD)
----------------------------
Referes to deploying configurations and applications to devices the organization doesn't own.
This stratagy makes use of Mobile device Management (MDM) such as Microsoft Intune to manage personally owned devices.

--------------------------------------
Explore the User State Migration Tool
--------------------------------------

USMT captures user accounts, user files, operating system settings and application settings of an existing machine.
	- Can be used for both PC replacements and PC refresh migrations

USMT enables you to do the following:
	- Configure migration according to your bussiness needs
	- Fit your customized migration into your automated deployment process using the ScanState and Loadstate tools - control collecting and restoring user files and settings
	- Perform offline migrations - By using the ScanState command in Windows PE

Identifying which components to migrate
---------------------------------------

	- User Accounts 					 
	- Application settings				
	- Operating-system settings	
	- File types, folders and settings

Using USMT
----------
The components of USMT include:

	- ScanState.exe 	- Scans the computer, collects the files and settings and then creates a store. 
	- LoadState.exe 	- Migrates the files and settings, one at a time from the store to a temporary location on the desitination computer.

Specify MigApp.xml, MigUser.xml, and MigDocs.xml with the ScanState and LoadState commands to migrate application settings, user profile data, and user folder/files to computers that are running Windows.


-----------------------------------
Explore client virtualization
-----------------------------------
Hyper V - Local virtualization
Windows Sandbox
	- Pristine		- Everythime Windows sandbox runs, it is a clean instance
	- Disposable	- nothing persists on the device, everything is deleted within the Sandbox after its closure
	- Secure 		- Uses hardware-based virtualization for kernal isolation, relies on Microsoft Hypervisor to run a separate kernel
	- Efficient 	- Uses kernel scheduler, smart memory management and virtual GPU
