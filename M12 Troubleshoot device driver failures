M12 Troubleshoot device driver failures
	-------------------------------------------
	Objectives 

	* Describe the role and importance of device drivers.

		Device drivers are the reponsible party for providing communication between a PnP device/component and the Windows operating system, without the driver the component/device will be inoperable.

	* Manage and troubleshoot device drivers.
		- tools that can be used to manage devices & device drivers
			# device manager (devmgmt.msc)
			# Windows device console (devcon.exe) 
			# Devices and printers - Control Panel
			# Powershell cmdlets
				Enable-PnPDevice 
				Disable-PnPdevice
				Get-PnPDevice
				Get-PnPDeviceProperty

				note that if a driver is causing startup issues for a windows device, starting the device in safe mode will bypass the driver.

				Sigverif.exe - Signature verification tool - determines if Windows is using any unsigned drivers and if signature enforcement is disabled.
				Run Sigverif.exe to scan for unsigned drivers.
				Review the resulting log file.
				Create a temporary folder for the unsigned driver storage.
				Manually move any unsigned drivers from C:\WIndows\System32\Drivers into the temporary folder.
				Disable or uninstall the associated hardware devices.
				Restart the computer.

				Command prompt - driver query /si


	* Explain the difference between the staging and installation of device drivers.
			Staging lists the drivers in the driver store without installing them, allowing a standard user to perfom the installation process.

			Windows checks that the driver does not require any additional LocalSystem security context during instlalation, Windows evaluates the driver packages:
			Is the driver signed?
			Is the driver specific to the attatched device or for a compatible set of devices?
			What is the driver version?

		Benifits of staging driver packages:
				* Improved security
				* Reduced support costs
				* Better user experience

		Staging device drivers manually 
				Pnputil.exe command
				1. Obtain a digitally signed driver package.
				2. Sign in as Administrator, and then open a command prompt.
				3. At the command prompt, type pnputil.exe /add-driver package_name, and then press Enter.
				4. The command runs, and Windows verifies the driverâ€™s integrity and digital signature, and then copies the driver into the driver store.


		Manage the driver store
				pnputil.exe /add-driver d:\usbcam\USBCAM.inf 						Adds a package that USBCAM.inf specifies.

				pnputil.exe /add-driver c:\drivers*.inf 							Adds all packages in C:\drivers.

				pnputil.exe /add-driver a:\usbcam\USBCAM.inf /install 				Adds and installs a driver package.

				pnputil.exe /enum-drivers 											Lists all non-Microsoft packages.

				pnputil.exe /delete-driver oem0.inf 								Deletes package oem0.inf.

				pnputil.exe /delete-driver oem0.inf /force 							Forces deletion of package oem0.inf.

	* Restrict installation of device drivers by using Group Policy.

			Automatic device driver can be restriced in GPO
