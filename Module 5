			Balanced		Medium				Can turn off display 			Measures activity - provides power when needed
			Power Saver		Least				Default - Display of A 5 min 	Saves energy by reducing performance
			High Performanc	Highest				Screen = highest brightness		Keeps hardware continiously supplied with power

	\Manage drivers and device peripherals
		Examine device drivers
			A device driver is a program that communicates with a hardware device on one side and the operating system on the other.

			Installing drivers manually
				A Driver package is a file set that makes up a device driver. A driver package is device-specific and enables windows to communicate with the device. 
				A Driver package includes:
				- The .inf file.
				- Any file that the .inf file references
				- The catalog (.cat) file that contains the digital signature of the device driver.

				Once a driver is installed it will be located within the driver store (%SystemRoot%\System32\DriverStore)

			32-bit and 64-bit drivers
			Note that the two different bit drivers are not cross-compatible. Windows 11 does not support 32-bit drivers and is less distributed lately.

			Driver store

			The driver store is the Windows driver package repository (truste location) %SystemRoot%\System32\DriverStore

		\Manage device peripherals

			You can find installed devices within the control panel, settings app and device manager. note that the devices can be managed and configured from these locations

		\Examine printer configuration
			Printer port
				Windows automatically detects printers when you connect them to the computer and installs the printer driver automatically if conencted to the driver store. However, Windows operating system might not detect printers you connect using older ports, serial (COM), parallel (LPT) ports or network printers. - in these cases you must install the printers manually

			Printer and printer driver
				Methods of installing a printer

					- manually install a driver via the pnputil.exe command
					- Run the "Add Printer Wizard" to install the printer
					- USB printers requires you to install the printer driver before attatching it.

						- Add a locally attatched printing device automatically - add the driver to the driver store and it should automatically conenct
						- Manually browsed for a shared network printer
						- Find a printer in the directory - When in an AD DS enviorment, administrators has the availibility to share the printer. (share printer)
						- Deploy printers by using Group policy settings - Right click the printer in print management and select deploy with GPO
						- Deploy by using GPO preferences - You can use GPO preferences to create, update, replace and delete a printer.

			Understand Type 3 and 4 printer drivers
				Comon printing languages include PCL, PostScript and XPS

				Type 4 printer driver module includes the following benifits:
					- Sharing a printer doesn't require adding extra drivers that match the client architechture
					- A single type 4 driver can support multiple printer models
					- Driver files are isolated on a pre-driver basis, which prevents potential driver file-naming conflicts
					- Driver 4 packages are smaller and more streamlined that Type 3 drivers - Type 4 installs faster as well.
					- Printer driver and user interface can be deployd independently 

			Manage client-side printing
				The Print Management Console provides a single interface through which you can administer multiple printers and print servers and perform management tasks, such as:
					- Add and remove print servers.
					- Add and delete printers.
					- Add and manage drivers.
					- Manage print queues.
					- View and modify status of printers.
					- Create custom filters to view printers that match certain criteria.



Explore advanced configuration methods
	======================================================
	{cscript C:\Windows\System32\slmgr.vbs -dli}
	
	Retail 	- use the product key provided to complete the activation
	
	OEM 	- OEM sells devices with custom images/activated windows devices
	
	Microsoft Volume Licensing	
								- A series of software licensing tailored for your organization. Volume licensing agreements are signed 
								- with Microsoft (AD based activations, KMS, Multiple Activation keys [MAKS])


		\KMS Activation
			When working to implement KMS activation, keep in mind the following considerations:

			- Client computers that aren't activated attempt to connect with the KMS host every two hours.
			- To stay activated, client computers must renew their activation by connecting to the KMS host at least once every 180 days.
			
			- After activation, client computers attempt to renew their activation every seven days. After each successful connection, the expiration extends to the full 180 days.
			
			- KMS activation requires at least 25 computers to run Windows Client for activation to be successful.
			
			- Client computers connect to the KMS host for activation using anonymous remote procedure calls (RPCs) over TCP/IP and default port 1688. You can configure this port information. The connection is anonymous, enabling workgroup computers to communicate with the KMS host. You might need to configure the firewall and the router network to pass communications for the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) port you've configured.

		\MAKS Activation (multiple activation key)
			Allows activation of computers that are isolated from KMS servers. MAK's are availible for activating multiple computers

			MAK can be used to activate computers in one of two ways:
				- MAK Independent:	- This activation method requires that each computer connect independently and activate with Microsoft over the internet/telephone
				- MAK Proxy:		- Centralized activation requests on behalf of multiple computers with one connection to Microsoft.

		\ADBA (Active Directory-Based Activation)
			Enables enterprises to activate computers by connecting to their domain. When a user connects to the domain, the ADBA object automatically activates Windows installed on their computer, as long as the computer ahs a Generic Volume License Key (GVLK)

	\Group Policy 

		Group policy settings comes in three states
			- Enabled
			- Disabled
			- Not Configured

		Two distinct types of group policy settings
			- User Settings		- HKEY_CURRENT_USER
			- Computer settings - HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE

		Each having three areas of configuration
		Section								Description
		Software settings					Can be deployed to a user or computer

		Windows operating system settings	Contains script settings for user and computer 
		
		Administrative templates			Contains settings that modify the registry to control various aspects of the user and computer enviorment.
											Note that templates are downloadable 

	\Applying GPO's

		GPOs apply in the following order:
			1. Local GPO
			2. Site GPO
			3. Domain GPO
			4. OU GPOs
			5. Child OU policies

			AD DS objects in the containers receive the cumulative effect of all policies in their preceding order. with conflict between settings, the last policy applies takes effect. The Administrator can assisgn preference value to control the processing order if multiple policies apply simutaneously.

	\Use Windows Powershell
		Some common windows powershell drives are:
			- The C drive
			- The cert drive for local certificate store
			- The Env drive - environmental vairiables stored in memory
			- The HKCU drive - HKEY-CURRENT-USER
			- The HKLM drive HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE
			- The Variable drive - contains the variables that are stored in memory.
