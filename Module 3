Configuring authentication and authorization
	--------------------------------------------

	Athentication
		----------------------------------------
		The process that provides the users identity when he or she accesses a resource.

			- Permissions are defined for resources internally 
			- Permission values are verified whenever a user tries to access the resources

	Authentication methods
		> Kerberos version 5 protocol 
			- Windows based systems use this as the main sign-in authentication method 
		> NTLM
			- provides backwards compatibility for systems and applciations (less flexible, less efficient and not as secure as Kerberos)
		- Certificate mapping
			- utilized in conjunctions to smart cards

	Account Types
		---------------------------------------
		Local Accounts
		An account that resides on the account locally.

		Microsoft Account
		A Microsoft account that is linked to a Microsoft Live ID, enables the user to have access to their Microsoft Services and online "Synced" data.

		Domain Account
		Accounts that are linked to a domain, provides access to resources within the domain (other clients, printers, servers using Active Directory)
			Centrally Managed

	Manage Local users and groups
		---------------------------------------
		Default Local user accounts
			- used to manage access to the local client's resources based on the rights assigned to the account
			- created automatically (build-in user) when Windows is installed.
			- Can't be removed/deleted
			- Don't provide access to network resources

		Administrator account
			- Has full control over files, directories, services and other resources on the local computer.
			- Can create other users, assign rights and permissions
				> The default Administrator account can't be deleted/renamed. The must be at least one administrator account on the local computer.
				> Best practice is to disable the build-in Local administrator account and to create a new Administrator.

		Default Account
			- Build-in account.
			- Should be left at default disabled state
			- Used to run processes that are multi user aware or user agnostic.

		Default local system accounts
			- SYSTEM account
			- NETWORK SERVICE account
			- LOCAL SERVICE account

		Using Groups (Build-in groups)
			- Administrators
			- Users
			- Guests
			- Device Owners
			- Event Log Readers
			- Hyper-V Administrators
			- Network Configuration Operators
			- Remote desktop users

	Explore Domains and Workgroups
		-------------------------------------------
		Workgroup
			- All computers have equal rights
			- Can't be password protected.
			- Has a limit of 20 computers
			- All computers must be on the same local network.
			- Works on all windows versions.
			- Works on both IP versions: IPv4 and IPv6
			- Every computer must have the same workgroup name to communicate.
			- Requires security sharing permissions to be set.

			User accounts are required to be set up on each computer. For when users access a network resources- they need to provide credentials to access the resource.

		Domain
			- Administrative boundary
				> The Administrative account has full capabilities over all objects within the domain.
			- Replication boundary
				> AD DS replicates updated objects and synchronizes information between domain controllers.
				> AD DS consists of three elements, or partitions:
					>> The Schema
					>> The Configuration partition
					>> The domain partition (changes most frequently)
			- Authentication boundary
				> Enables users that are appart of the domain to authenticate to any resources apart of the domain. Domains in an AD DS forest trusts one another, and these trusts enables a user from one domain to access resources held in another domain.

			A computer can belong to one domain/workgroup only

	Explore credential manager
		--------------------------------------
		Windows credential manager helps manage and maintain passwords

	Explore Windows Hello
		------------------------------------------

		Windows hello provides support for a personal identification number (pin) or biometric authentication

		Windows Hello addresses the folloing problems with passwords:
			- Strong passwords can be difficult to remember, and users often reuse passwords on multiple sites.
			- Server breaches can expose symmetric network credentials (passwords).
			- Passwords are subject to replay attacks.
			- Users can inadvertently expose their passwords due to phishing attacks.

		Windows Hello authentication methods
			- PIN
			- Biometrics
			- Hello
			- For Bussiness
			- Configured by group policy or MDM
			- Allows you to authenticate to:
				> Microsoft account
				> AD account
				> Azure AD account
				> Identity Provider Services or Relying Party Services that support Fast ID Online (FIDO) v2.0 authentication (in progress)

	Configure password policies and user properties
		-------------------------------------------------

		Using group policy to configure password policies
			Configurable options - Location = Computer Configuration\Windows Settings\Security Settings\Account Policies.

			Setting 					Description 								Default Setting

			Password policy\Enforce password history	Enforce password						By default, group policy remembers 24 passwords

			Password policy\ Maximum password 		Maximum password age 						Default is 42 days

			Password policy\Minimum password 		Minimum password age 						Default is one day

			Password policy\Minimum password lenght		Minimum password lenght						Default is seven characters

			Password policy\PWD complexity requirements	Passwords require to meet complexity req 			Three of the four complexity elements must be present. Enabled by default (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, S)

			Account lockout policy\A Lockout threshold	Invalid sign-in attempts (A lock threshold)			Default value is 0 = never lock.

		User account settings that can affect the sign-in process
			Setting 		 							Description

			User Logon name 							Username when signing in

			Unlock account 								If the user has locked their account

			User must change password at next logon					When enabled, user must change their password at next sign-in

			User cannot change password 						If enabled, user cannot change their password - typically used for service accounts

			Password never expires							When enabled, the user will not be prompted to change their password - overides password policies - set for service accounts and more.

			Account is disabled							Enabling this setting prevents users from signing into their account

			Smart card is required for 				 	
			interactive logon							User is required to use smart card to perform sign ins

			Account expires								Allows a date to be set for when an account expires

	Explore user profiles and their contents
		-----------------------------------------------------------------------

		Each user has a folder within C:\Users that contains the users profile typically named after the username of the User

			- User profiles
				> Contains user-specific settings
				> Are stored in C:\Users by default
			- Include
				> Registry settings
				> Folders, including 
					>> Appdata, Desktop, Favourites, Documents
			- Public profile contents are included for all users

		User profile contains
			> NTuser.dat file - appart of the registry. Loaded when a user signs in - MAPS to HKEY_CURRENT_USER registry subtree - Contains user settings

			> A set of folders
				>> Application configuration fiels (AppData)
				>> Desktop
				>> Favorites
				>> Documents
				>> Downloads
				>> Music, Pictures, Videos
				>> Other folders specific applications create

		Public profile
			> By default there is a public profile availible to all users, C:\Users\Public

Manage Users and groups
	==============================================================
	Explore Active Directory
		----------------------------------------------------------

		- AD uses a structured data store as the basis for a logical, hierarchical organization of directory information, represented as objects.
		- AD services (AD DS) facilitate authorization and managing permissions to the services and data those objects represent.
		- Organizations may have Hybrid Exchange deployments that include on-premises Exhange Servers and a Microsoft 365 tenant that supports Exchange Online.
		- Administrators can sychronize AD DS and Azure AD together using the Azure AD Connect Tool.
			> Password Hash synchronization
				>> sign in method that sync's the hash of a user's on-prem AD password with Azure AD
			> Pass-through authentication
				>> Sign-in method that allows the user to have the same sign- in password on prem and in Azure. 
			> Federation intergration
				>> AD FS - enables users to sign into Azure Services with on-prem passwords-while on corporate networks the users won't require their passwords again.
			> Syncronization
				>> Responsible for syncing/creating users, groups, and other objects - includes password hashes.
			> Health Monitoring
				>> provides robust monitoring in a central location of resources

	Compare AD DS vs Azure AD
		---------------------------------------------------------
		Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)
			- AD DS is a true directory service, with a hierarchical X.500-based structure.
			- AD DS uses DNS for locating resources such as domain controllers.
			- You can quary and manage AD DS by using Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) calls.
			- AD DS primarily uses the Kerberos protocol for authentication.
			- AD DS uses Organizational Units (OUs) and Group Policy Objects (GPOs) for management.
			- AD DS includes computer objects, representing computers that join an Active Directory domain.
			- AD DS uses trusts between domains for delegated management.

		Azure AD
			- Azure AD is primarily an identity solution, and itâ€™s designed for internet-based applications by using HTTP (port 80) and HTTPS (port 443) communications.
			- Azure AD is a multi-tenant directory service.
			- Azure AD users and groups are created in a flat structure, and there are no OUs or GPOs.
			- You canâ€™t query Azure AD by using LDAP; instead, Azure AD uses the REST API over HTTP and HTTPS.
			- Azure AD doesn't use Kerberos authentication; instead, it uses HTTP and HTTPS protocols such as SAML, WS-Federation, and OpenID Connect for authentication, and uses OAuth for authorization.
			- Azure AD includes federation services, and many third-party services such as Facebook are federated with and trust Azure AD.
	
	Sign Into a Domain
		--------------------------------------------------------------
		Failure to sign into a domain could be due to the following reasons:
			- Authentication fails
			- Windows used cached credentials
			- Authentication is very slow but successful

		Reauthentication after applying/reconfiguring object rules (updating user's groups/permissions)
			- To reauthenticate one must sign out and sign back in or restart the device

			Typical failure might be because of
				> Domain controller unreachable
				> Name Resolution issues
				> Physical network issues.

		Azure AD authentication
			Typically when a user attempts to sign in, the client computer must locate where the authentication services reside by using DNS.

			Reasons for failure include:
			- Name-resolution issues:
			- Internet connectivity isn't availible
			- Synchronization issues between on-premises AD DS and Azure AD

	Manage users and groups using Active Directory
		---------------------------------------------------------------

		Active Directory groups
			- Distribution groups 
				> Used to greate email distibution lists. Can be used only with email applications - used to send to a collection of users.
				> Distribution groups are not security enabled, which means they cannot be listed in discretionary access control lists (DACLs)
			- Security Groups
				- User rights
				- Permissions

			- Default security groups
				> DnsAdmins
				> Domain Admin
				> Domain Computers
				> Domain Users
				> Enterprise Admins - 

				> IIS_IUSRS - Built in group - Internet Information Services
				> Print Operators
				> Remote Desktop Users
